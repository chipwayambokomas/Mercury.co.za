This was my first project outside of school guidelines. I was tasked with beginning the development of the website for the largest logistics company in Zambia as a way for the CEO to give me some experience and learn my way around developing the Front-end of a website.

## What I Learned

* Styling div components using css files 
* Using react hooks such as useState to change the state of div components and make the website actually respond to user engagement 
* Making functions and classes dynamic, passing props between them as well as using array mapping to complete repetetive div components
* Creating a mini-search enginge within the website to search for specific blogs with relevant titles: This was my favorite part as the CEO allowed me to get creative 
* Read css stylings of figma documentation 
* Routing pages
* How to make a working carosel
* How to make a drop-down menu
