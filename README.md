# MyPortfolio

I created this portfolio because I was recently asked to present one and realized I did not have one. It was good practice for me as well as I learnt a new way to style div components using Tailwind which was fun.

## What I Learned

* Tailwind styling instead of creating seperate css files

## Dependencies 

* Tailwindcss
* react-icons
* react-router-dom
* Google-Fonts
